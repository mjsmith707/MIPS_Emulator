CS390 MIPS32 Release 2 Emulator

- An interpreter for a big endian MIPS32 Release 2 processor that
implements most arithmetic, memory, shifting, etc. instructions, as well as
coprocessor 0 support, most exception types, and interrupts. Future plans are
for coprocessor 1 (floating point) support.

Compiling Instructions:
	Run 'make' to build mips.x which can then be used to load
		mips32r2 big endian elf binaries. E.x. ./mips.x mmon.elf
	Run 'make test' to build mips_tests.x which executes various
		instruction unit tests.

- Overview of files:
	main.cpp - Handles machine startup/shutdown.
	ConsoleUI.cpp/h - Handles stdin/stdout and acts as a bridge
		between the terminal and emulated UART8250.
	FileLoader.cpp/h - Parses argc/argv and executes file related
		functions such as ELF and binary file loading.
	CPU.cpp/h - Contains the interpreter core loop as well as most
		instruction implementations.
	PMMU.cpp/h - Contains the memory management unit emulation class
		which handles read/write, address translation etc.
	Coprocessor0.cpp/h - Contains the control coprocessor registers
		as well as functions to operate on them.
	COP0Register.cpp/h - Implements coprocessor0 specific register
		behavior including per bit software/hardware read/write 
		locking.
	MIPSException.cpp/h - Contains the implementations for all MIPS
		exception types.
	MMIO_Device.h - Abstract interface for memory-mapped IO devices
		in order to attach to the MMU.
	SharedQueue.h - Template locking std::queue, primarily for use in
		ConsoleUI to receive messages for logging purposes.
	UART8250.cpp/h - Partial (no interrupts) implementation of a
		UART8250 serial port using memory-mapped IO.
		See: ./mips.x mmon.elf for a working example
	SharedDefs.h - Contains miscellaneous definitions that need to be
		used by multiple components. (E.x. TLB size).

	STest:
		testmain.cpp - Adds tests to STest interface and starts
			STest.
		STest.cpp/h - Contains simple unit testing framework as
			well as template assertion functions.
		MIPS_Tests_Common.cpp/h - Contains class objects and
			functions common to all instruction tests.
		ArithmeticTests.cpp/h - Contains tests for instructions
			from Table 3.1 (pg 34) MIPS32R2 Volume II.
		LogicalTests.cpp/h - Contains tests for instructions from
			Table 3.5 (pg 36) MIPS32R2 Volume II.
		BranchAndJumpTests.cpp/h - Contains tests for instructions
			from Table 3.2 (pg 35) MIPS32R2 Volume II.
		InstructionControlInstructionTests.cpp/h - Contains tests
			for instructions from Table 3.3 (pg 36) MIPS32R2 
			Volume II.
		LoadStoreMemoryControlTests.cpp/h - Contains tests for
			instructions from Table 3.4 (pg 36) MIPS32R2
			Volume II.
		InsertExtractTests.cpp/h - Contains tests for instructions
			from Table 3.6 (pg 37) MIPS32R2 Volume II.
		MoveTests.cpp/h - Contains tests for instructions from
			Table 3.7 (pg 37) MIPS32R2 Volume II.
		ShiftTests.cpp/h - Contains tests for instructions from
			Table 3.8 (pg 37) MIPS32R2 Volume II.
		TrapTests.cpp/h - Contains tests for instructions from
			Table 3.9 (pg 38) MIPS32R2 Volume II.
		ObsoleteBranchTests.cpp/h - Contains tests for instructions
			from Table 3.10 (pg 38) MIPS32R2 Volume II.
		PrivilegedInstructionTests.cpp/h - Contains tests for instructions
			from Table 3.23 (pg 42) MIPS32R2 Volume II.
	Misc:
		Contains some miscellaneous things such as benchmark
			results.

		DispatchTests - Test code used for poster benchmarking.
		MIPSTest - Code for basic exception handling, timer interrupt
			and context switch testing. (See ./mips.x timer_test.elf)

	elfio:
		Unmodified elfio library (C) Serge Lamikhov-Center. Used for
		loading ELF file formats.
