CS390 MIPS32 Release 2 Emulator

- Currently an interpreter for a big-endian mips32 release 2 processor that
implements most arithmetic, memory, shifting, etc. instructions, with plans
to add coprocessor0 support as well as floating point (coprocessor1).

Compiling Instructions:
	Run 'make' to build mips.x which can then be used to load
		mips32r2 big-endian elf binaries. E.x. ./mips.x mmon.elf
	Run 'make test' to build mips_tests.x which executes various
		instruction unit tests.

- Overview of files:
	main.cpp - Handles machine startup/shutdown, elf file loading.
	ConsoleUI.cpp/h - Handles stdin/stdout and acts as a bridge
		between the terminal and emulated UART8250.
	CPU.cpp/h - Contains the interpreter core loop as well as most
		instruction implementations.
	PMMU.cpp/h - Contains the memory management unit emulation class
		which handles read/write, address translation etc.
	Coprocessor0.cpp/h - Contains the control coprocessor registers
		as well as functions to operate on them.
	COP0Register.cpp/h - Implements coprocessor0 specific register
		behavior including per bit software/hardware read/write 
		locking.
	MMIO_Device.h - Abstract interface for memory-mapped IO devices
		in order to attach to the MMU.
	SharedQueue.h - Template locking std::queue, primarily for use in
		ConsoleUI to receive messages for logging purposes.
	UART8250.cpp/h - Partial (no interrupts) implementation of a
		UART8250 serial port using memory-mapped IO.
		See: ./mips.x mmon.elf for a working example
	STest:
		testmain.cpp - Adds tests to STest interface and starts
			STest.
		STest.cpp/h - Contains simple unit testing framework as
			well as template assertion functions.
		MIPS_Tests_Common.cpp/h - Contains class objects and
			functions common to all instruction tests.
		ArithmeticTests.cpp/h - Contains tests for instructions
			from Table 3.1 (pg 34) MIPS32R2 Volume II.
		LogicalTests.cpp/h - Contains tests for instructions from
			Table 3.5 (pg 36) MIPS32R2 Volume II.
		BranchAndJumpTests.cpp/h - Contains tests for instructions
			from Table 3.2 (pg 35) MIPS32R2 Volume II.
		InstructionControlInstructionTests.cpp/h - Contains tests
			for instructions from Table 3.3 (pg 36) MIPS32R2 
			Volume II.
		LoadStoreMemoryControlTests.cpp/h - Contains tests for
			instructions from Table 3.4 (pg 36) MIPS32R2
			Volume II.
		InsertExtractTests.cpp/h - Contains tests for instructions
			from Table 3.6 (pg 37) MIPS32R2 Volume II.
		MoveTests.cpp/h - Contains tests for instructions from
			Table 3.7 (pg 37) MIPS32R2 Volume II.
		ShiftTests.cpp/h - Contains tests for instructions from
			Table 3.8 (pg 37) MIPS32R2 Volume II.
		TrapTests.cpp/h - Contains tests for instructions from
			Table 3.9 (pg 38) MIPS32R2 Volume II.
		ObsoleteBranchTests.cpp/h - Contains tests for instructions
			from Table 3.10 (pg 38) MIPS32R2 Volume II.
	Misc:
		Contains some miscellaneous things such as benchmark
			results.
